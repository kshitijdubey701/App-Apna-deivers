-- Deferred ledger-balance validation + append-only enforcement.
--
-- Prisma's schema DSL cannot express triggers or deferred constraints, so
-- this is a hand-written raw-SQL migration (per the project rule: "use raw
-- SQL migrations where Prisma cannot express PostgreSQL requirements
-- correctly"). Captured here as its own migration, applied by
-- `prisma migrate deploy`/`dev` immediately after 20260909000000_init in
-- normal migration order. The identical, standalone copy at
-- prisma/sql/001_ledger_balance_trigger.sql remains as a manual fallback
-- for a database that already has the Phase 1-10 tables but no migration
-- history (see prisma/sql/001_ledger_balance_trigger.sql's own header).
--
-- Why a DEFERRED trigger and not a plain CHECK constraint: LedgerEntry rows
-- for one FinancialTransaction are inserted one at a time (one INSERT per
-- debit/credit line) within a single application-level transaction. An
-- immediate constraint would reject every insert except the last one, since
-- the set of entries for a financial_transaction_id is only balanced once
-- all of them exist. DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED defers the check to
-- COMMIT time, by which point the whole transaction's rows are all present.

-- Row-level shape: exactly one of debit_amount/credit_amount is positive,
-- the other is exactly zero. This is a single-row invariant, so a plain
-- (non-deferred) CHECK constraint is correct and sufficient here.

  ADD CONSTRAINT ledger_entries_single_sided_check
  CHECK (
    (debit_amount > 0 AND credit_amount = 0)
    OR (credit_amount > 0 AND debit_amount = 0)
  );

-- Transaction-level shape: SUM(debit_amount) = SUM(credit_amount) for every
-- financial_transaction_id, checked once at commit (or at an explicit
-- SET CONSTRAINTS ledger_entries_balance_check IMMEDIATE).
